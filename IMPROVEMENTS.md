# Improvements

A list of things that I need to refactor/improve:

  - Architecture of Layouts/Blocks instances saved in Builder class and their generated ACF configs. I want to be able
    to know which generated config comes from what block and layout.
  - Maybe the same is needed for all the fields also stored to the Builder in the map/flatmap
